## About The Project

![screenshot of the project](screenshot.png)
<br>
 This project asked me to build a real-time weather application using the open weather API. By inputting a city name the API is called to fetch current and future weather conditions for that city. The elements are then dynamically created on the page, along with search history buttons.
